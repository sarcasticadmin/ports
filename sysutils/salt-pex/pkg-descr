Salt-pex : Salt tool the form of a single binary
======================================

Salt is a great tool to configure the system. Unfortunately, python's
package manage can make dealing with system versions of python and
its dependencies somewhat fragile. Salt-pex aims to help stablize
salt using the Python EXecutable (pex) files.

Salt is a powerful remote execution and state manager that can be
used to administer servers in a fast and efficient way.
